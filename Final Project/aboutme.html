                    <p>Hey there! I'm Dan. I study Computer Science at UAlbany. I'm mostly interested in software engineering and backend development, but I also have a little bit of interest in frontend web development.</p>
                    <p>I love to travel and visit new places, especially in my hometown of New York City. There's always a new restaurant to go and try or a new attraction to visit just for fun. My absolute favorite place to visit is The Edge Observation Deck in Hudson Yards, NY. It's a 1100+ ft. outdoor observation deck and the view makes me speechless.</p>
                    <p>If I'm not traveling, I spend a good chunk of my free time watching movies. I love sci-fi and thriller type films. Horror movies are also good, but I'm less inclined to watch them. One of my all-time favorite movie is Interstellar(2014). Although, it's been a long time since I've watched it, the mysterious ending always leaves me hooked to it.</p>
