                    <p>Hey there! I'm Dan. I study Computer Science at UAlbany. I'm mostly interested in software engineering and backend development, but I also have a little bit of interest in frontend web development.</p>
                    <p>I love to travel and visit new places, especially in my hometown, New York City. There's always something new to see and do in the city. If I'm not travelling, I spend a good chunk of my free time watching movies. I love sci-fi and thriller films. Horror movies are also good, but I'm less inclined to watch them.</p>
